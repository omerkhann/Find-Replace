“Find/Replace” tool implementation, found in a typical text editor. Program asks
user to enter a text of max length 500 characters. Then the program asks which word the user want to
find in the text. Followed by which word should be used to replace the word. In the end the program will
display the resultant text. The program will continue to take request from the user unless user enters
empty word to find in the text.
